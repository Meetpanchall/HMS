                                    <h2>Retina Problems</h2>
                                    <p>The retina is like the film of the camera which sends the image to the brain for processing. A damaged retina can lead to significant visual disturbances many of which may become permanent if not treated in time. The retinal diseases are some of the most common causes of a permanent loss of vision in many patients, if not treated on time.</p>
                                    <P>Some retinal problems are treatable or preventable. The type of treatment you receive and its outcomes depend on factors such as the type of problem that you have and your goals. In some cases, this may be to slow or even stop a disease or infection. For others, the strength of the retina can be preserved or even restored along with your vision.</P>
                                    <p>It’s incredibly important to seek treatment if you suspect that you’re having retina problems. Failure to do so can result in significant vision loss and even blindness. Our team of Knoxville eye surgeons is here to help you with whatever problems that you may have, providing treatment for your retina problems and preserving your sight for years to come.</p>

                                    <h3>Symptoms of Retinal Problems</h3>
                                    <p>Symptoms of retinal problems are similar since they affect the same part of the eye. This can be helpful for you in knowing that something is wrong with your retina. However, you will need to see one of our Knoxville eye specialists to confirm a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. </p>
                                    <p>Retinal problems often manifest themselves in your field of vision, alerting you that something is wrong. Common symptoms of retinal issues include:</p>
                                    <ul class="list-style-one clearfix">
                                         <li>Floating specks or cobwebs</li>
                                         <li>Wavy or blurred lines </li>
                                         <li>Loss of vision</li>
                                         <li>Defects in your peripheral vision</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>It’s important to keep in mind that both of your eyes have retinas. This means that one of your eyes may be functioning normally while the other is having retinal problems. To narrow down which is having the problem, simply close one eye and look through the other, repeating the process with the opposite eye to determine which is malfunctioning.</p>
