                                    <h2>Squint</h2>
                                    <p>Squint or strabismus is known by various other names like deviating eye, crossed, and wandering eye. This is a peculiar disorder of eyes in which the eyes are not aligned properly.This simply means when one of the eyes looks straight then at the same time another one starts to turn upwards, downwards, inward, or outwards.This kind of misalignment in the eyes might remain constant in few patients while in others it might occur intermittently.</p>
                                    <p>Squint is not only a cosmetic problembut if not treated at the proper time can create another disease known as Amblyopia or most commonly known as lazy eyes. Amblyopia occurs in young children, so it is very important to identify & treat squint as soon as possible.</p>

                                    <h3>Symptoms Of Squint</h3>
                                    <p>Since it is not easy to distinguish between a squint and an unusual look of the eyes, it becomes difficult to diagnose the Symptoms of squint. Sometimes squint is intermittent,this makes it even more difficult to identify the disease. Therefore, to properly assess and diagnose the squinting of eyes, a squint specialist should be consulted. Some of the most usual symptoms of squint are:</p>
                                   <ul class="list-style-one clearfix">

                                         <li>Photophobia: Children who are suffering from squint eyes are susceptible to bright sunlight and canâ€™t ignore it and subsequently tend to close their eyes.</li>
                                         <li>Abnormal head posture: Some patienttilt or turn their heads and face a particular directionto utilize their eyes together or avoid diplopia.</li>

                                            <h3>Squint Treatment:</h3>
                                            <p>Treatment of squint is medical management or surgery.</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Correction of refractive error: Squint caused by refractive errors can be corrected by prescribing suitable corrective spectacles to the patients.</li>
                                                <li>Treatment of amblyopia (Lazy eye): The problem of Amblyopia is treated with the help of occlusion therapy.</li>
                                                <li>Surgical Treatment: Sometimes it becomes necessary to take the help of surgical methods to treat the humongous problem of squint. This kind of corrective surgery can be completed in a single day. During the surgery, the muscles of the eyes are detached from their original insertion spot and are being properly and carefully shifted to a different spot. This amount of shifting is strictly and precisely measured with special prisms.</li>
