# HMS 
A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and manage the administrative, clinical, and financial aspects of a hospital or healthcare facility. It integrates various functions like patient registration, appointment scheduling,   staff management, and reporting into a unified platform. An HMS enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and improves patient care by providing real-time access to data, automating routine tasks, and facilitating communication between departments.
